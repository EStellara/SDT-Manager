# Open Existing Project Feature - COMPLETED âœ…

## Overview

The SDT Manager now supports opening and importing existing dialog tree projects through both a user-friendly file picker interface and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. This feature allows you to load previously exported projects and continue working on them seamlessly.

## âœ… Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All planned features have been successfully implemented and tested:

### âœ… Core Features Implemented:
1. **File Import Utilities** (`src/lib/fileImport.ts`)
   - File picker dialog with format filtering (.json, .zip)
   - Automatic file type detection and processing
   - ZIP file extraction and validation using JSZip
   - JSON project parsing and validation
   - Character merging and conflict resolution
   - UUID regeneration to prevent ID conflicts

2. **Drag-and-Drop Support** (`src/lib/useDragAndDrop.ts`)
   - React hook for drag-and-drop functionality
   - File type filtering during drop operations
   - Visual feedback with drag-over states
   - Support for multiple files with first-file selection

3. **Enhanced HomePage** (`src/pages/HomePage.tsx`)
   - Updated "Open Existing Project" card with drag-and-drop
   - Loading states during file operations
   - Error handling with dismissible messages
   - Visual indicators for drag-and-drop support
   - Integration with DialogProjectContext

4. **CSS Styling** (`src/index.css`)
   - Drag-over visual feedback with border and scaling
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects
   - Theme-consistent styling with primary colors

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - File import utility tests (`src/test/golvis-fileimport.test.tsx`)
   - HomePage functionality tests (`src/test/sue-homepage.test.tsx`)
   - Drag-and-drop behavior tests
   - Error handling and edge case coverage
   - Mocked dependencies for reliable testing

## Supported File Formats

### 1. JSON Project Files (.json)
- **Single Project Files**: Complete projects exported as a single JSON file
- **Individual Tree Files**: Exported dialog trees with associated characters
- **Legacy Format Support**: Backward compatible with older export formats

### 2. ZIP Project Files (.zip)
- **Structured Project Archives**: Organized project exports with separate files for:
  - Project metadata (`project.json`)
  - Character definitions (`characters.json`) 
  - Project variables (`variables.json`)
  - Individual dialog trees (`trees/*.json`)

## How to Use

### Method 1: File Picker (Click to Browse)

1. **Click "Browse Files"** in the "Open Existing Project" card
2. **Select your project file** from the file picker dialog (.json or .zip)
3. **Wait for import** - the system will automatically detect the file type
4. **Review any errors** if the import fails, with helpful error messages
5. **Navigate to editor** - successful imports redirect you to the project editor

### Method 2: Drag and Drop (NEW!)

1. **Drag your project file** (.json or .zip) from your file explorer
2. **Drop it onto** the "Open Existing Project" card
3. **Visual feedback** confirms when you're over the drop zone
4. **Automatic processing** - same validation and error handling as file picker
5. **Seamless import** - loads project and navigates to the editor

### User Experience Features:
- **Dual Input Methods**: Both file picker and drag-and-drop support
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Loading spinners during file operations
  - Drag-over indicators with border highlights and scaling
  - Clear success/error messages
- **Error Recovery**: Dismissible error messages with clear descriptions
- **Format Support**: Automatic detection of JSON and ZIP formats
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Error Handling

The import system provides detailed error messages for common issues:

- **Invalid file format**: "Invalid project format - missing required fields"
- **Corrupted ZIP files**: "Invalid project zip: missing project.json"
- **Malformed JSON**: Parse errors with specific line information
- **Missing data**: Validation errors for incomplete projects
- **Unsupported file types**: Files are filtered and rejected gracefully

Error messages are displayed in a dismissible notification panel with clear icons and action buttons.

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- **20+ Unit Tests** for file import utilities (`src/test/golvis-fileimport.test.tsx`)
- **15+ Integration Tests** for HomePage functionality (`src/test/sue-homepage.test.tsx`)
- **8+ Drag-and-Drop Tests** covering all interaction scenarios
- **Comprehensive Mocking** of JSZip, file operations, and context providers

### Manual Testing
- **Sample Project File**: `sample-project.json` provided for testing
- **Interactive Test Page**: `test-drag-drop.html` for drag-and-drop verification
- **Browser Compatibility**: Tested with modern browsers supporting File API

### Sample Project Contents:
- **3 Characters**: Hero, Merchant, and Guard with full profiles
- **2 Dialog Trees**: Opening conversation and merchant dialog
- **Project Variables**: Game state variables like gold and reputation
- **Complex Branching**: Multiple choice options and character interactions

## Technical Implementation

### File Import System
```typescript
// File picker integration
const file = await openFilePicker(".json,.zip");
const project = await importProject(file);
dispatch({ type: "LOAD_PROJECT", payload: project });
```

### Drag-and-Drop Hook
```typescript
// Reusable drag-and-drop functionality
const { dragProps, isDragOver } = useDragAndDrop({
  onFileDrop: handleFileDrop,
  accept: [".json", ".zip"]
});
```

### Technologies Used:
- **JSZip**: ZIP file extraction and processing
- **React Context**: Integration with existing project management
- **UUID Generation**: Unique identifiers for imported entities
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing ensures data integrity
- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth visual feedback for drag operations

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Modular Design**: Separate utilities for file operations and UI interactions
2. **Reusable Components**: Drag-and-drop hook can be used elsewhere
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback
4. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient file processing with minimal UI blocking
5. **Accessibility Compliant**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

While the core feature is complete, potential future improvements include:

- **Recent Projects Persistence**: Save and load recently opened projects from localStorage
- **Batch Import**: Import multiple tree files simultaneously
- **Import Preview**: Preview project contents before importing
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Support for cloud-based project storage
- **Progressive Loading**: Streaming import for very large projects
